# NBA_Over-Under_Prediction
This repository contains an NBA over/under prediction app built with Python and Flask. The app uses machine learning to make predictions on the over/under bets for NBA games. The user can input information about a game and the app will provide a prediction on the over/under total.

# Basic Architectural Plan
Will be updated + made prettier once I have more of the plan built out.
